# Sense of taste bias

I am not a scientist of human gustatory system. I just want feedback about my thoughts.

Please give me feedback. Please tell me typos and unclear sentences.

About taste in general (from Wikipedia)

> Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foodsâ€™ nutritional value.

> The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami

I think there is a major bug in our gustatory system.

We can't really taste proteins.

From Wikipedia:

> People taste umami through taste receptors that typically respond to glutamates, which are widely present in meat broths and fermented products and commonly added to some foods in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and others.

We add salt and other flavor enhancers to our pasta to fool ourselves.

It tasts better but the content is still the same.

It is like buying a fancy racecar, but the racecar's engine has the power of a moped.

We fool our self daily.

The next bias is how the food looks.

A light-brown lentil soup looks boring.

Fast food looks nice.

> Humans have a multitude of sensors. Sight (vision, visual sense), hearing (audition, auditory sense), taste (gustation, gustatory sense), smell (olfaction, olfactory sense), and touch (somatosensation, somatosensory sense) are the five traditionally recognized senses. 

Two of our senses tend to prefer
food which does not give us
what we really need.

# Biases

There is a list of biases at Wikipedia.

Up to now the taste bias is not part of this list:
